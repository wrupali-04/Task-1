Hi! This task explores the Customer Personality Analysis dataset to understand different types of customers based on their spending habits, demographics, and lifestyle choices. The goal is to help businesses segment their audience better so they can personalize marketing, improve product targeting, and increase customer satisfaction.

I do this by performing the following tasks: (i) Cleaned the dataset, (ii) Performed EDA (income, spending, age, correlations, etc), (iii) Created useful features (Age, TotalSpend, FamilySize), (iv) Applied clustering, (v) Visualized customer segments.

The project files include:
(i) task1.py - program created to perform the task
(ii) marketing_campaign.csv  - dataset used for the task
(iii) cleaned_customer_personality.csv - the cleaned csv file
